# Disconcerted Musings
This project is yet another Markdown content hosting platform.  The goal of this is not to use any too-fancy browser features for a consstent experience.  I made this specificially to fulfill my needs: taking notes in [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) and publishing them.  I'm aware of [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) but I wanted to reinvent the wheel.

# Deploying
1. Install Node.js (I used v20) and NPM.
2. Clone the repo
3. Run ```npm i```
4. Tweak the config to your needs (check [CONFIG.md](/CONFIG.md)!)
5. Run ```node index.js``` in the background (needs to be continuously running so that it can handle new content)
6. You're done!

# Architecture
TODO
